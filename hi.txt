hello. 
the video of the mustard fields is great in that it provides an aerial view. this is true because it was shot on a drone. however, the music was slighlty inappropriate in how uppity it was. this is only the opinion of Javian. it is okay if you feel otherwise, although you should give it some thought. 
okay. bye.
